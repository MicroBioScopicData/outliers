# Python Statistical Analysis: A Guide to Identifying and Handling Outliers

Welcome to this tutorial on detection, plotting, and treatment of outliers with Python. In this tutorial, we will start by discussing what outliers are and why they matter. We will then cover methods for detecting outliers, including graphical methods and statistical tests. Once we have identified outliers in our data, we will explore different approaches for handling them, such as removing them, or replacing them. Throughout the tutorial, we will use practical examples and real-world dataset to illustrate the concepts and techniques. The dataset (dataset named “cells”) is based on an experiment where the diameter of cells/spores of the fungus *Aspergillus nidulans* was measured under a microscope. The dataset consists of a single column of numerical values representing the diameter of the cells in micrometers. By the end of this tutorial, you should have a solid understanding of how to detect and handle outliers in your data, enabling you to produce more robust and accurate analyses and models.
